- scoring between categories based on user navigation history

- absolute scoring of entities:
    - popularity
    - number of neighbours
    - importance for certain user (based on past accesses, IP based)
    - sum of score of neighbours (propagation, similar to how search engines propagate hyperlink importance)
    - caching! (memoization, keep score for a period of time (1 day?) )
    - keep a top (priority queue?) of best scores

- relative scoring of one entity related to another:
    - number of edges between them
    - influenced by absolute score
    - relative score of their categories (domain, gender, year, etc.)
        - number of accesses by same user of both (categories)
    - number of accesses by same user of both (entities)
